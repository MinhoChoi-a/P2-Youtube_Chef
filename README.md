## Prerequisites
-	Node.js
-	Google API account (This application uses Youtube Data API V3.)

Also, this web app uses a several npm packages.
-	axios (to make api call)
-	react-player (I chose this rather than iframe since developers can set more specific state of video like 'onReady')
-	material-ui (set overall web component style)
-	etc.

*you should do following command to install those packages.
```
npm install
```

*if you want to try it on your localhost you should create production build first
```
npm react-scripts build
```
